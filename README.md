## Getting Started
The following instructions have two different ways to run the program.

### Running the program via .exe
1) Clone the repository to your machine
2) Create two folders within the directory for your Designated Folder and Downloads
3) Run "DistributedFileSystemGUI.exe"

### Running the program via client_gui.py
1) Clone the repository to your machine
2) Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt
3) Create two folders within the directory for your Designated Folder and Downloads
4) Run "client_gui.py"
   
## Using the application

When the application starts running you are presented with these options:

1) **Select directory:** Choose the directory to where you want your downloaded files to save to.
2) **Search file:** Enter the name of the file along with the file extension type to search. E.g. text.txt
3) **Select file to monitor:** Choose the directory to where you want the folder_monitor to access and monitor.
4) **Launch Monitor**: Once you have chosen your file monitor directory in Step 3, this button will start the folder_monitor monitoring of directory.
