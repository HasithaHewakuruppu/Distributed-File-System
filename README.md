# Distributed File System Project

This project implements a basic distributed file system using Python. 
It consists of three main components: a server, a seeder, and a client. 

The server tracks the files available from seeders, 
the seeder monitors a designated folder and informs the server about the file changes, 
and the client can query the server to check if a file exists.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your machine.

1) Make folders called DesignatedFolder and Downloads in the current directory of the files
2) Run the folder_monitor.py if you want to share files with the network if not don't
3) Run the client.py and search a file you like to download with the extension. eg physics.pdf
4) Then follow the prompts
