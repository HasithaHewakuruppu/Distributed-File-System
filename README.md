# Distributed File System Project

This project implements a basic distributed file system using Python. 
It consists of three main components: a server, a seeder, and a client. 

The server tracks the files available from seeders, 
the seeder monitors a designated folder and informs the server about the file changes, 
and the client can query the server to check if a file exists.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your machine.

1) Install the required dependecies using pip install -r requirements.txt

3) Run the folder_monitor.py if you want to share files with the network if not don't
